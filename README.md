# rust-auto-piano-player

This is my first actual rust project.

So it's probably very ugly and bad.

I hope if theres something so stupid someone makes a pr to make it less stupid and I will learn.

# Usage

Build the project with `cargo build`

Inside `target/debug/auto_piano_player.exe` drag a song file onto the executable.

The song schema is inside `schema/piano_song.json`

Some sample songs are inside `songs/`;
